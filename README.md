# 2nd-lsb-oracle
2nd-lsb-oracle for NTNU 2022 info sec class HW
## hint
let message <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m"> be seperated into its lsb(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=b_1">) and other parts(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m'">).

for convenience, we will use <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=|"> as a representation for bits concatenation. in other words, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=m=(m'|b_1)_2">

the situation of oracle with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2m"> as input can be separate in two case. you can observe some interesting characteristic along with **bit string of N** while analyzing **oracle return result**.

## objective
you have to decrypt the ciphertext generated by the server and obtain the flag for the score. all your steps and scripts shall be recorded and documented in the report, otherwise you will get zero points as result.
## flag format
NTNU{```some ascii characters```}
## how to use
1. please install python3 and [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) in your local computer
  * for linux & OSX user, please refer the [official installation guide](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/install.html)
  * for windows user, please directly use ```pip3 install pwntools```(```pip3``` may be ```pip``` according to your installation)
2. please modify the server ip specify in ```client.py```
    ```py
    import pwn
    proc = pwn.remote('127.0.0.1', 7000) # modify me
    while True:
        print(proc.recv().decode())
        inp = input().encode()
        proc.send(inp)
        if inp.strip() == b"2":
            proc.send(input().encode())
    ```
3. run ```python3 client.py``` and see if there is a prompt like the following
    ```
    $ python3 client.py 
    [+] Opening connection to 127.0.0.1 on port 7000: Done
    welcome to NTNU orcale service
    please input your action
    1) get service source code
    2) get leastest 2nd bit from input ciphertext
    3) get ciphertext & public key
    4) donate asef18766
    ```
## issue & problem in use
if you have any problem in using client, please open issue in github page. otherwise, i will ignore all your requests. \
