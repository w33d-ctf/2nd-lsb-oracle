# 2nd-lsb-oracle
2nd-lsb-oracle for NTNU 2022 info sec class HW
## objective
you have to decrypt the ciphertext generated by the server and obtain the flag for the score. all your steps and scripts shall be recorded and documented in the report, otherwise you will get zero points as result.
## flag format
NTNU{```some ascii characters```}
## how to use
1. please install python3 and [pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) in your local computer
  * for linux & OSX user, please refer the [official installation guide](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/install.html)
  * for windows user, please directly use ```pip3 install pwntools```(```pip3``` may be ```pip``` according to your installation)
2. please modify the server ip specify in ```client.py```
    ```py
    import pwn
    proc = pwn.remote('127.0.0.1', 7000) # modify me
    while True:
        print(proc.recv().decode())
        inp = input().encode()
        proc.send(inp)
        if inp.strip() == b"2":
            proc.send(input().encode())
    ```
3. run ```python3 client.py``` and see if there is a prompt like the following
    ```
    $ python3 client.py
